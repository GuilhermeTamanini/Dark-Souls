      Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. is a Japanese multinational video game
      publisher headquartered in Minato-ku, Tokyo. Its international branches,
      Bandai Namco Entertainment America and Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe,
      are respectively headquartered in Irvine, California and Lyon, France. It
      is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bandai Namco Holdings, an entertainment
      conglomerate. Bandai Namco Entertainment was formed on 31 March 2006,
      following a corporate merge between Namco and Bandai on 29 September of
      the previous year. Originally known as Namco Bandai Games, it merged
      Bandai Games and Namco Networks in January to create Namco Bandai Games
      America. Namco Bandai Games absorbed Banpresto's video game division in
      2008 and dissolved Bandai Networks in 2009. Development operations were
      spun off into a new company in 2012, Namco Bandai Studios (now called
      Bandai Namco Studios), to help create faster development time and tighter
      cohesion between development teams. Namco Bandai Games was renamed Bandai
      Namco Games in 2014 and again to Bandai Namco Entertainment a year later.
      Bandai Namco Entertainment owns several multi-million video game
      franchises, including Pac-Man, Tekken, Gundam, Soulcalibur, Tales, Ace
      Combat, Taiko no Tatsujin, The Idolmaster and Dark Souls. Pac-Man, himself
      serves as the official mascot of the company. As of March 2022, it is the
      third largest video game company in Japan in terms of revenue and market
      capitalization, after Sony Interactive Entertainment and Nintendo, ahead
      of Sega, Square Enix, Nexon, Capcom and Konami. The company also owns the
      licenses to several Japanese media franchises, such as Shonen Jump, Kamen
      Rider, Super Sentai, Sword Art Online, and the Ultra Series. It is the
      core publishing and development area of the Bandai Namco Group's "Content
      Strategic Business Unit" (Content SBU), and the main video game branch of
      Bandai Namco Holdings.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      In February 2005, in the wake of their 50th anniversary, Namco announced
      their intent to merge with Bandai to form Bandai Namco Holdings. The merge
      was finalized on 25 September, creating the third-largest video game
      publisher in Japan by revenue. Bandai purchased Namco for US$1.7 billion,
      with Namco receiving 43 percent of shares and Bandai receiving the other
      57 percent. Both companies in a joint statement cited Japan's decreasing
      birth rates and advancements in technology as the reason for the merge,
      and to increase their relevance to newer audiences. Both companies worked
      independently under the newly formed Bandai Namco Holdings until March 31,
      2006, when their video game operations were merged to form Namco Bandai
      Games. Earlier on 26 January, Namco Hometek and Bandai Games merged to
      form Namco Bandai Games America, the North American division. On 1 April
      2008, Banpresto's video game operations were absorbed by Namco Bandai
      Games. On 1 April 2009, Bandai Networks, Namco Bandai's mobile phone
      business, was dissolved and absorbed into Namco Bandai Games. Just prior
      to the release of Afro Samurai at the end of 2008, the company announced
      the Surge publishing label. The new label was an attempt at creating a
      separate identity for the company, aimed at a Western audience desiring
      more mature themes in-game content. Following Afro, early press materials
      indicated that Dead to Rights: Retribution and Splatterhouse would also be
      released under the Surge label, but neither game ultimately did; both were
      released with a retro Namco label instead to reflect the series' legacy,
      the Surge branding would be phased out following the release of Afro
      Samurai. In 2010, Namco Bandai Games entered the Guinness World Records as
      the company that released the most TV commercials for the same product, a
      Nintendo DS game called Solatorobo: Red the Hunter. They created 100
      versions of the ad as the game consists of 100 chapters. In early 2011,
      Namco Networks was absorbed into Namco Bandai Games America, effectively
      consolidating Namco Bandai's American console, handheld, and mobile video
      game development operations. On 2 April 2012, Namco Bandai Games spun off
      its development operations into a new company called Namco Bandai Studios.
      The new company was spurred by Namco Bandai's interest in faster
      development times and tighter cohesion between disparate development
      teams. It comprises approximately 1,000 employees, who were already part
      of Namco Bandai. In March 2013, Namco Bandai Games established two new
      game studios. The first, Namco Bandai Studios Singapore, is Namco Bandai's
      "leading development center" in Asia and develops game content for the
      Asia Pacific market. The second studio, Namco Bandai Studios Vancouver,
      works on online social games and game content development for North
      America and Europe, and is part of the Center for Digital Media (CDM). In
      July 2013, Namco Bandai Partners (NBP), which used to oversee the PAL
      distribution network since September 2012, merged with Namco Bandai Games
      Europe (NBGE) in order to push distribution and publishing into one
      entity, Namco Bandai Games Europe (NBGE). Previous logo was used from 2015
      to 2022 In 2014, Namco Bandai Games and Namco Bandai Studios became Bandai
      Namco Games and Bandai Namco Studios, respectively. The change unified the
      brand internationally in order to increase the "value" and "appeal" of the
      name. The full company name was changed to Bandai Namco Entertainment on 1
      April 2015. On 1 April 2018, the amusement machine business division of
      Bandai Namco Entertainment was transferred over to sister company Bandai
      Namco Amusement. In September 2020, Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe and
      Oceania acquired Canadian video game developer Reflector Entertainment.
      The company acquired minority stake in Limbic Entertainment in February
      2021. In March 2021, Bandai Namco Amusement announced that withdrawal of
      the arcade game facility business in North America due to closure of
      various gaming facilities from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the
      announcement, Bandai Namco Amusement America was not affected by this
      withdrawal. In April 2021, Bandai Namco Entertainment America announced it
      would close its Santa Clara office and move to a new Southern California
      office. In June 2022, Bandai Namco Entertainment and ILCA. Inc announced
      the establishment of Bandai Namco Aces, with 51% of the shares owned by
      Bandai Namco and 49% of the shares owned by ILCA. This new development
      company will be responsible for the development of AAA titles, including
      Ace Combat.
